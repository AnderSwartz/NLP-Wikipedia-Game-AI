Welcome to my Wikipedia Game AI! This project simulates the challenge of trying to get from one Wiki page to another using only hyperlinks contained within different Wiki pages. The goal of the game is for two people (or in this case, an AI) to use the least amount of intermediate Wiki pages when traveling from the origin to the target page.

If you have Jupyer Notebooks downloaded, you may open up the NLP Wiki Project (Final Version)-Demo.ipynb file to view and run the code. The first 8 cells can be run to set up the project, which involves importing the GloVe and Wikipedia API's, and defining the functions to be used. 
After this, the 8th and 9th cell contain comments and examples of how to run call the relevant functions to find a path between your chosen Wiki pages. You may disregard the rest of the code, which was used for testing and data collection.
